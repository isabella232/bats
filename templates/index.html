        <p>With wild lands shrinking and humans covering more and more of it, conservationists can no longer mark off huge areas of wilderness to preserve wildlife. The notion of unsullied land is romantic, but there's not enough of it to maintain America's increasingly endangered flora and fauna &ndash; like bats. </p>

<p>Many of North America's 44 bat species are in grave trouble. The caves where they hibernate are crowded with tourists and cavers. As their habitats disappear, so do they -- and so do their sounds.</p>

<p>There have been some creative conservation efforts. On the northern tip of Michigan, there’s been a movement to conserve a collection of abandoned, underground copper mines — an alternative habitat for bats. The hazardous mines often are sealed up, killing millions of bats and eliminating places for hibernation. But locals have helped Bat Conservation International design special gates for the mines that keep people out while allowing bats to come and go.</p>

<p>And to conserve the sounds, NPR reporter Chris Joyce and sound engineer Bill McQuay traveled to Michigan a few years back. They recorded this environment, and many others, for a collaboration between NPR and National Geographic called Radio Expeditions.</p> 

<p>They were captured as binaural recordings: Sound was gathered using two microphones to simulate the experience of how humans hear sound in real life — with two ears and a head in between. But until now, the recordings have been sitting in an archive. We’ve resurrected and remixed them for a 3-dimensional listening experience with headphones.</p>

<p>Check out a full playlist of 3-D sounds on Soundcloud.</p>
